  <h3><a name="about" id="about"></a>About DrunkDuck</h3>
  <p>DrunkDuck is a website that provides free hosting services for webcomic creators.&nbsp; Founded in 2002 by Dylan Squires, it has evolved into one of the largest online webcomic communities with over 7,000 comic strips and stories.&nbsp; In addition to free hosting, DrunkDuck also provides free message boards and forums for its members, as well as a user rating system that allows for feedback and ranking of its webcomics.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>In the past four years, DrunkDuck has undergone two data losses and four design revisions.&nbsp; The first loss, in 2003, was caused by a full server failure.&nbsp; In 2005, the site&rsquo;s host shut off their servers due to financial difficulty, losing massive amounts of data in the process.&nbsp; As a testament to the strength of its community, Drunk Duck&rsquo;s creators returned in droves on both occasions.</p>
  <p>In August of 2006, DrunkDuck was purchased by Platinum Studios, an entertainment company controlling the world&rsquo;s largest independent library of comic characters, and producing comics based entertainment in film, television, internet, mobile, and print.&nbsp; Dylan Squires stayed on with the company becoming the Director of Software Development for Platinum Studios&rsquo; New Media Group. With this new support, DrunkDuck has been able to immediately upgrade to a dedicated server and begin backing up the data for its thousands of creators, preventing the possibility of another crash and improving site performance.&nbsp; It is currently undergoing an ongoing series of design changes and upgrades. These upgrades include new tools for the creators as well as improvement in the community functions.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Our mission for DrunkDuck is to make the best possible home on the web for webcomics, and for the webcomics community.</em></strong></p>

  <h3>Why a duck?</h3>
  <p>Shortly before Dylan Squires founded DrunkDuck in 2002, his pet duck, Professor Quackers, passed away.&nbsp; One of his friends, designing a logo for Dylan&rsquo;s new site, drew a cartoon of the deceased Professor Quackers as a joke.&nbsp; The logo stuck (for a short while) and Dylan, believing Dead Duck to be a less than appealing company name, decided that the cartoon duck could just as easily be passed out after a night of heavy drinking rather than the more morbid alternative.&nbsp; Thus, DrunkDuck was born.</p>
