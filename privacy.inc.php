  <h2><a name="Etiquette" id="Etiquette"></a>DrunkDuck Etiquette </h2>
  <p>DrunkDuck is a great place for hosting your comics. It is a wonderful community that will welcome you with open arms and treat you with respect. </p>
  <p>Great communities however do not spring from thin air. In order to foster a respectful, welcoming and creative community, we kindly ask that users do not engage in trollish behavior. This includes forum flames, disrespectful behavior to other members and flame baiting. Users who do engage in such behaviors will be suspended/removed and eventually banned. Should there be any personal disagreements or concerns between members, we ask that the users involved resolve the matter privately. </p>
  <p>DrunkDuck has no interest in wantonly oppressing or interfering with a user's artistic pursuits. While you are perfectly in your right to say what you want and exercise your freedom of speech, please bear in mind that DrunkDuck is privately owned and operated. In other words, it is not a public access site and the administrative team will modify or take down content if necessary. We reserve the right to remove or take down any art, comments, etc. we find inappropriate for any reason.</p>
  <p>That said, you are pretty much able to do anything you want with your comic account as long as you follow the Terms of Use and these rules: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Don't disrespect your comic host (DrunkDuck). Constructive criticisms are welcomed but don't bite the hand that feeds you. </li>
    <li>Don't disrespect your (DrunkDuck) community members. </li>
    <li>Violation of other artist&rsquo;s copyrights is not acceptable. If you use artwork without permission of its creator, and the creator/copyright holder complains to the administrators, we will remove the offensive file. If you continue to do this, we will delete your account. </li>
    <li>If you find someone is using your artwork without permission and would like to see it stop, do not hesitate to contact an administrator for help. Do not begin a flame war with the offending user. </li>
    <li>Do not tamper with the DrunkDuck headers or footers on your page. We need those there for legal and administrative reasons. If you link off of DrunkDuck to your own page please have the courtesy to provide a link back to DrunkDuck.</li>
    <li>Understand that Administrators reserve the right to remove your account for the reasons above.</li>
    <li>Circumvention of our authority and punitive system is reason for permanent banning.</li>
  </ol>
