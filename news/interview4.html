                  <p><strong>Did you begin the comic with the intention of making it into such a widely read comic?</strong></p>

                  <p>Honestly, I was certain the only audience I would have was my friend who introduced me to DD! In fact, when I first started posting CTV, it was to test my comics with an unbiased audience (suffice it to say, my close friends were impressed by my worst of Bic-pen scribbles) to see if it was worthy to send to a publisher or not. Ambitious yes, but rather naive of me since the artwork was absolutely atrocious! I intended to only post a few of the one-shot pages that didn't really relate to the story arc. But everyone was supportive and kind and offered me good advice without making me feel like a complete moron, so I actually wanted to improve. Not just for myself, but for all those wonderful people. I wanted to share the rest of the story, and I wanted to make it a good story at that. But even though I always listen to what people want, I've kept the comic as I envisioned and what makes sense to me. If I don't like a page, I'm sure it will show and no one else will like it either! I honestly couldn't tell you what I think appeals to so many readers, I know I can't please everyone and different folks will interpret the comic differently. Someone even called the entire thing angsty and devoid of character development. For as much positive feedback I get, I find enough off-site panning to keep me thoroughly humbled! (Or simply more depressed than usual!)</p>
