                  <p>Honestly, I was certain the only audience I would have was my friend who introduced me to DD! In fact, when I first started posting CTV, it was to test my comics with an unbiased audience (suffice it to say, my close friends were impressed by my worst of Bic-pen scribbles) to see if it was worthy to send to a publisher or not. Ambitious yes, but rather naive of me since the artwork was absolutely atrocious! I intended to only post a few of the one-shot pages that didn't really relate to the story arc. But everyone was supportive and kind and offered me good advice without making me feel like a complete moron, so I actually wanted to improve. Not just for myself, but for all those wonderful people. I wanted to share the rest of the story, and I wanted to make it a good story at that. But even though I always listen to what people want, I've kept the comic as I envisioned and what makes sense to me. If I don't like a page, I'm sure it will show and no one else will like it either! I honestly couldn't tell you what I think appeals to so many readers, I know I can't please everyone and different folks will interpret the comic differently. Someone even called the entire thing angsty and devoid of character development. For as much positive feedback I get, I find enough off-site panning to keep me thoroughly humbled! (Or simply more depressed than usual!)</p>

                  <p><strong>What are your favorite comics today?</strong></p>

                    </tr>
                  </table>
                  <p>So many to choose from! In print, I was introduced to Scud: The Disposable Assassin and Crimson by some good friends of mine only a year or two ago, and certain arcs of the Army of Darkness series, especially if the artist Nick Bradshaw is doing the pencils. Newspaper comics I like are &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; (though my paper doesn't carry it) and Hal Foster's &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;. As for Web comics, there's quite a few I'm still catching up on and the list of faves is too long to list here. Just a few are: Jump, 3rd Party Fantasy, Vampire Phantasm, Mildly Mundane, Ever Hollow, The Adventures of the Blue Kotatsu and Vindibudd. A few of my faves were scattered to the wind after the big crash, sadly. Off DD, I read Sins: Venials and I'm still trying to get through the archives of Zebra Girl (slow dialup internet, ugh!)</p>
                  <p><strong> What recommendations would you give to the starting artist?</strong></p>
                  <p>Never put the cart before the horse, the horse isn't going to push it! Don't be afraid to listen to advice, and don't be put off by it. Not everyone that dislikes your stuff is a &quot;brainless moron&quot; or &quot;just jealous&quot;, because everyone has a right to their own opinion, as well as you do. Art wise, I would recommend a lot of practice, but because every artist would say that too, I'll just say try to do your own thing as best as possible. And if you're going to do someone else's thing, do it better than them! Try to blend your influences though, think of it like making a cake. If you do it right, it should taste like a cake, not its ingredients. Same goes for art: if you can see your biggest influence in your art, so can everyone else. Most of all, do what you enjoy. Having fun drawing will be a sure way to improve, so do what's fun. If I'm not having fun drawing a comic, I draw something else. It keeps me motivated to sit at the drawing table another hour, and not abandon it because the page isn't turning out like I wanted. And never think in terms of your limitations, because you can overcome them. If you spend all your time thinking you will never improve, then you won't. If you convince yourself you can't draw a circle, you won't. I have a wrist that hurts whenever I use it, but if that put me off drawing, Charby would never be where it is today. Bottom line: just do it and keep going! </p>
                  <p><strong>How does it feel to be so recognized and get so much feedback for your comic on Drunk Duck?</strong></p>
                  <p>I have mixed feelings really. I absolutely love to hear from people who bother to read the comic! It truly makes me feel special. But at the same time it makes me paranoid. It seems sometimes that &quot;popularity&quot; gives some people the idea that it is their right to &quot;take you down a notch&quot;. For example, I have been regarded to rather coldly in recent times by a few of the very same people who were very friendly to me when my comic was still very small. I'm not saying everyone is like this but it has happened enough times, and it really hurts when it happens. I guess it's easier for some to assume you're a self-centered snob because you have more readers, than to bother getting to know you at all. But I care about my readers a great deal. They have been a tremendous support both on the comic and in my life offline, and I really feel that I owe them a good comic at the very least, so I try my best for them. I listen to every one of them too and I've even taken a lot of advice, so I don't want anyone to think just because I have a lot of comments that I don't take every one into consideration!</p>

                  <p>Hopefully, I can make a career out of this someday...hopefully very soon. I do intend to get either Charby or Unlife is Unfair published or printed somewhere. I would also like to meet as many of the fine people who've supported me as possible, should I ever come into enough money for such a goal! As much as I'd like to make money off my comic though, I have a fear of it becoming like many other comics lumped into the &quot;Goth&quot; genre: commercial with no substance. In fact I have a comic in mind that has more merchandise than comics (grand total of one issue!) I don't want to be like that. I don't want to meet someone on the street wearing a Charby shirt who doesn't know there was a comic to go along with it. </p>
                  <p><strong>Did you think up your whole story before writing it out or do you do work out the story as you go along?</strong></p>
                  <p>A little bit of column A, A little bit of column B. I have had the entire thing thought out for ages, as well as quite a few of the story arcs, but I like to leave it a little flexible. It's not as fun when you're doing something because you have to, I admit. Sometimes I gauge reader reaction before I move on to another arc or make a big decision on something.<br />
                      <strong><br />
                      What comics inspired you when you were growing up?</strong></p>
                  <p>Contrary to what some people believe, I never read a single &quot;gothic&quot; comic before starting Charby ( through almost all of its initial offline run, which was around 600 or so pages before I posted the first one online) but the most inspiring comics to me were mostly those in the newspaper of course. I hadn't even set foot in a comic store until a few years ago honestly! Among those most inspiring were Bill Watterson's &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; ( whom I will admit played a small part in Charby's early proportions as well as some surreal in-jokes as homage to that comic), Charles Schulz's &quot;Peanuts&quot; (again proportion and sometimes you'll spot a little influence from time to time) &quot;Garfield&quot; (yes Garfield, it was funny at one time, and had a lot more characters) and though I wasn't an avid reader of MAD, I saw a few old copies in a box of old comics and was particularly interested in &quot;Spy Vs Spy&quot;. I was discouraged from copying artists at a young age so I always kept a watch on my art to make sure whatever influences and elements I picked up, they were evenly mixed with my own particular style. Still, this sadly doesn't stop people from wrongfully assuming my comic is a carbon-copy of a certain popular Goth comic about a homicidal maniac. Overall I would have to say what inspired me most in regards to CTV was the Golden Age of Animation, (1940's Looney Tunes to be specific)and old cautionary tales and poems from the 1800's that were recited to me by my grandpa. Boy, was that dark humor at its finest! Nothing made junior behave quite like telling him he'd get his thumb lopped off if he sucked on it, or he'd shrivel to nothingness if he was a picky eater!</p>

                  <p>It all started with a picture. A random character I drew in a spiral notebook while sitting at a Denny's restaurant, a vampire boy with spiky hair thinking &quot;I like Chicken&quot;. It was somewhere in very late 2001, and that character sat there for a long while, dormant. The notebook was likely lost in the clutter for a while in my room. After I graduated high school, I went to a summer art program. While sitting amongst the collective artists, mulling for ideas, I suddenly got the idea to combine the words &quot;vampire&quot; and &quot;pirate&quot; together and make a character. I seriously don't know why that popped into my head, though! I flipped open my sketchbook and drew that little vampire again, and instead of the stuffy, clich&eacute; &quot;Dracula&quot; garb I'd had him in originally, I gave him a striped pirate shirt (based on an actual shirt of a male friend of mine, whom I said reminded me of a pirate in said shirt) and a couple of pirate hooks. At first I was going to call him Rondo (an amusing name of a street, which later became another character) but after hearing the name &quot;Charby&quot; (a nickname someone I know made up to log a pal's cell-phone address, turns out it's a real name after all) I thought it would be much cuter for the character (and piratey-er because of the &quot;ar&quot; in it). Soon I had all sorts of ideas and characters, though the bulk of the cast was selected from old sketchbooks and remodeled designs. I blame a bit of the character explosion on reading some vampire/mythology encyclopedias along the way though. CTV was originally intended to be a direct spoof on the horror genre, but then I decided to do a lot more with it. Much of the early archives on DD were these horror parodies, as well as a few &quot;wishful thinking&quot; comics where Charby of Hexavier get back at certain people, who happened to be a slight caricature of individuals who were rude to me in real life. A lot of early CTV was just me channeling my anger into the comic and it certainly helped me feel better!</p>
                  <p><strong> How long have you been doing Charby? </strong></p>
                  <p>Well, I started posting the comics on Drunk Duck (well, redrawing then posting) in January of '04, but CTV as a comic has been around since the summer of 2002.</p>
                  <p><strong>How long have you been making comics in general?</strong></p>
                  <p>While I did draw a few nonsense comics about a cowardly dachshund in elementary school, I &quot;officially&quot; started to do comics in middle school. My first comic endeavor was around 9 years ago with the ultra-violent one-panel comic &quot;Beck the Ferret&quot;, about a mute ferret with horrible luck. I did over 500 pages of those, plus another comic called &quot;Zero and J&quot;, which I didn't put quite so much effort into.</p>
                  <p><strong> What process do you use to make your comics?</strong></p>
                  <p>First I pencil sketch it onto printer paper with a mechanical pencil, then ink over those lines and erase the pencil. Sometimes I have a layout in mind, others I just draw haphazardly onto several sheets of paper and sort it out on the computer. I scan it into my computer and use Photoshop to color it with a mouse. The supplies I usually have are: either a Zig Millennium, Faber-Castell Pitt, or Micron pens for the inking process, any mechanical pencil that won't snap the lead into my face (usually .07 or .09 lead) and a kneaded eraser (no annoying eraser debris!)</p>
