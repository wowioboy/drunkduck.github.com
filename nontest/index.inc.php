Greetings all!
 <BR>
We are proud to announce our first annual<BR>

<H2>“Not A Contest” Valentine’s Promotion!</H2>

Ok. Well it’s “not a contest” but it’s definitely a promotion for Valentine’s day!<BR> <b><u>We are looking for the best creative works from Drunk Duck creators.</u> <BR> We  have two themes:</b>


 <BR><BR>

<font size="4"><b>Hate</B></font> Valentine’s Day? Great! Create a piece of <font size="4" color="#000000">Anti Valentines Day</font> art.

 <BR><BR>

<font size="4"><B>Love</B></font> Valentines Day? Create some art in the <font size="4" color="#af003e">True Spirit of Valentine’s.</font>
 <br><BR>

We don’t care! We won’t take it personally!

 <BR><BR>

And what do you get in return? A free booth at Wizard World? A million dollars? Total control of the free world?  No,  but our panel of “Not Really Judges” will pick a winner from each of the valentine’s categories, and that art will be made into a send-able e-card available the week of Valentine’s Day. Available only on Drunk Duck!

Now, even though this is “not a contest”, we do have some specs:

 <bR><BR>
 <font size="4">
First of all, we are<b> not making money from this “not a contest”, <u>nor do we retain the rights to any of the artwork</u></b> – it is all completely yours. It does not become the property of Platinum Studios.
 </font></center>


 <bR><BR>
1. There are <u>2 themes</u> that you can choose from: <b>VALENTINE’S AND ANTI-VALENTINE’S</b>, you can do either or both.  Anything outside of those themes is disqualified.

 <BR><BR>

2. What the judges will be specifically looking for are: the quality of the artwork, and the quality of the copy or “punchline”.

 <BR><BR>

3. You can submit as much as you like.


 <BR><BR>
4. They can be characters from your comic, or other drunk duck comics, but no copy written or licensed images are allowed.  You must have permission to use any characters that are not your own.


 <bR><BR>

5. The “Not Really Judges” for the Valentine’s “not a contest” will be: Carly (Creepy Carly), Ann (Dragonlova), Jim (Editor in Chief at Platinum), and Dylan (Volte6), and a surprise mystery judge!

 <BR><BR>

6. The cut off time for submitting entries is <b>midnight, Saturday FEBRUARY 3rd 2007</b>. The Judges will decide and vote on the winner by the 6th of February 2007.
 <bR><BR>


<b>There will be <u>2 wieners</u> – one for <u>Anti-Valentine’s</u> (send it to your ex!) and one for <u>Valentine’s Day</u> (e-cards are cheaper than flowers!). They will be featured on this page (Valentine’s “not a contest” promotion page).</b>


 <BR><bR>

We will also display 4 “Judges Choice” who will have their art displayed on the Valentines Promotional page with a link to all their drunk duck comics.  Judges Choice is each judges 1 personal favorite and can be either Anti or Pro.


 <BR><BR>

 <center>
<font size="4">These will go up on February 7th – and the winners artwork will be sendable as an e-card for the week before Valentine’s! The e-card will also feature a special link to the winner’s comic. </font>
